Stage 6.C/6.D/6.E/6.F/6.H — availability engine (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md § 6;
docs/DECISIONS.md § Stage 6 decisions, § Stage 6.C decisions, § Stage 6.D
decisions, § Stage 6.E decisions, § Stage 6.F decisions, § Stage 6.H
decisions).

Functional-core / imperative-shell split: _fetch_working_hours,
_fetch_time_off, _fetch_appointments, and _fetch_qualifying_specialists
(6.H) are the only four functions that touch the tenant-scoped ORM (and so
are the only four that require tenant context to already be bound, via
core.tenancy.tenant_context — they don't bind it themselves, same
convention as every other service-layer function in this project, e.g.
specialists/services.py's _future_appointments). Everything else here is a
pure function over plain values, in particular _subtract_intervals, which
knows nothing about TimeOff/WorkingHours/Appointment at all — the
generalised blocking-interval list a future closure source would plug into
without this function changing (6.D's Appointment support is exactly that
plugging-in, not a rewrite).

6.E adds one more layer of each kind on top of compute_open_windows,
without changing it: _step_windows (pure — plain numbers for
granularity_minutes/occupied_minutes, the Window/dt.datetime vocabulary
otherwise) and compute_candidate_start_times (the thin orchestrator, which
calls compute_open_windows itself rather than receiving windows as an
argument — docs/DECISIONS.md § Stage 6.E decisions).

6.F adds booking-window filtering on top of _step_windows's output, again
without changing it: _filter_candidates_by_booking_window (pure — plain
dt.datetime bounds, no knowledge of lead time, max advance, or timezones of
its own) and _max_advance_boundary (pure — the calendar-boundary arithmetic,
taking an already-resolved ZoneInfo rather than resolving one itself).
compute_candidate_start_times gains a required `now: dt.datetime` parameter
with no default, validated on its first line (docs/DECISIONS.md § Stage 6.F
decisions).

6.H adds the "any specialist" composition on top of
compute_candidate_start_times, without changing it:
_fetch_qualifying_specialists (the fourth ORM-touching function, above),
_merge_specialist_availability (pure — combines each specialist's own
candidate times into {start_time: [specialists free then]}, sorting keys
explicitly), and compute_multi_specialist_availability (the thin
orchestrator, which calls compute_candidate_start_times once per qualifying
specialist rather than receiving their results — the same shape already
established for compute_candidate_start_times itself calling
compute_open_windows). Re-validates `now` on its own first line rather than
relying on compute_candidate_start_times's inner guard, because zero
qualifying specialists would otherwise skip that inner call entirely
(docs/DECISIONS.md § Stage 6.H decisions).
