Soft delete only — Specialist rows are never hard-deleted once they could be
referenced by an Appointment (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md § 2), same as catalog's
Service/ServiceCategory (catalog/services.py). Deactivation is additionally
refused outright (409) if the specialist still has a future non-cancelled
appointment — docs/DECISIONS.md § Stage 5 decisions records why: this stage
has no payment/notification/conflict-resolution layer to honor the standing
rule (docs/DECISIONS.md § Business rules) that such a conflict must be
explicitly resolved, never silently orphaned.
